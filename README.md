# AWS-Palindrome_Anagram

You are provided with a list of palindromes (words that are spelt the same backwards & forwards).
Each entry in the list can be anagrammed to form at least 1 other entry in the list.
Create a program that, given the list, and any word within the list, can find the anagrammed palindrome for the given word.
